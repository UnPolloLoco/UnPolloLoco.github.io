# The Project Process

For the listeners back home, this is my final project for ITD 110.

## First Check-In

Jan. 24, over text;

For this check-in, I showed a basic layout idea of what the main page may look like. Most feedback was regarding the visuals. My client suggested that I switch to a dark theme, add more visual flair, or even add transition effects. He reiterated that the design should look professional and sleek.

I decided to shelf the special effects for later on, if time permits. As for the visuals, I changed everything to a darker style and added a new font (previously, it had just been the browser's default font).
